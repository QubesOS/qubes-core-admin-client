"""Qubes CLI spinner

A novice asked the master: “In the east there is a great tree-structure that
men call 'Corporate Headquarters'. It is bloated out of shape with vice
presidents and accountants. It issues a multitude of memos, each saying 'Go,
Hence!' or 'Go, Hither!' and nobody knows what is meant. Every year new names
are put onto the branches, but all to no avail. How can such an unnatural
entity be?"

The master replied: “You perceive this immense structure and are disturbed that
it has no rational purpose. Can you not take amusement from its endless
gyrations? Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming beneath its
sheltering branches? Why are you bothered by its uselessness?”
