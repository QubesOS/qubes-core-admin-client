'''VM features interface'''


class Features(object):
    '''Manager of the features.

    Features can have three distinct values: no value (not present in mapping,
    which is closest thing to :py:obj:`None`), empty string (which is
    interpreted as :py:obj:`False`) and non-empty string, which is
    :py:obj:`True`. Anything assigned to the mapping is coerced to strings,
    however if you assign instances of :py:class:`bool`, they are converted as
    described above. Be aware that assigning the number `0` (which is considered
    false in Python) will result in string `'0'`, which is considered true.
