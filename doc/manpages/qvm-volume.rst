:program:`qvm-volume` -- Qubes volume and block device managment
================================================================

Synopsis
--------

| :command:`qvm-volume` *COMMAND* [-h] [--verbose] [--quiet] [options] [arguments]

Description
-----------

.. TODO Add description

Options
-------

.. option:: --help, -h

   Show help message and exit

.. option:: --verbose, -v

   Increase verbosity.

.. option:: --quiet, -q

   Decrease verbosity.

Commands
--------

list
^^^^

| :command:`qvm-volume list` [-h] [--verbose] [--quiet] [-p *POOL_NAME*] [*VMNAME* [*VMNAME* ...]]

List block devices. By default the internal devices are hidden. When the
stdout is connected to a TTY `qvm-volume list` will print a pretty table by
omitting redundant data. This behaviour is disabled when `--full` option is
passed or stdout is redirected to a pipe or file.

.. option:: -p, --pool

   list volumes from specified pool

.. option:: --full

   print domain names

.. option:: --all

   List volumes from all qubes. You can use :option:`--exclude` to limit the
   qubes set. Don't forget â€” internal devices are hidden by default!

.. option:: --exclude

   Exclude the qube from :option:`--all`.

aliases: ls, l

info
^^^^
| :command:`qvm-volume info` [-h] [--verbose] [--quiet] *VMNAME:VOLUME* [*PROPERTY*]

Show information about given volume - all properties and available revisions
(for `revert` action). If specific property is given, only its value is printed.
For list of revisions use `revisions` value.

aliases: i

config
^^^^^^
| :command:`qvm-volume config` [-h] [--verbose] [--quiet] *VMNAME:VOLUME* *PROPERTY* *VALUE*

Set property of given volume. Properties currently possible to change:

  - `rw` - `True` if volume should be writeable by the qube, `False` otherwise
  - `revisions_to_keep` - how many revisions (previous versions of volume)
    should be keep. At each qube shutdown its previous state is saved in new
    revision, and the oldest revisions are remove so that only
    `revisions_to_keep` are left. Set to `0` to not leave any previous versions.
  - `ephemeral` - should the volume be encrypted with en ephemeral key? This can
    be enabled only on a volume with `save_on_stop=False` and `snap_on_start=True`
    - which is only `volatile` volume. When set, it provides a bit more
    anti-forensics protection against attacker with access to the LUKS disk key.
    In majority of use cases, it only degrades performance due to additional
    encryption level.

aliases: c, set, s

resize
^^^^^^
| :command:`qvm-volume resize` [-h] [--force|-f] [--verbose] [--quiet] *VMNAME:VOLUME* *NEW_SIZE*

Resize the volume with *VMNAME:VOLUME* TO *NEW_SIZE*

If new size is smaller than current, the tool will refuse to continue unless
`--force` option is used. One should be very careful about that, because
shrinking volume without shrinking filesystem and other data inside first, will
surely end with data loss.

.. option:: -f, --force

   Force operation even if new size is smaller than the current one.

aliases: extend

revert
^^^^^^

| :command:`qvm-volume revert` [-h] [--verbose] [--quiet] *VMNAME:VOLUME* [rev]

Revert a volume to a previous revision.  If *rev* is specified, reverts the
volume to that specific revision (discarding the current volume contents
and possibly deleting any newer revisions). If *rev* is not specified, the
contents of the volume are reverted to the latest known revision.  Your storage
driver must support revisions and its `revisions_to_keep` property must be
greater than `0`.

Generally, revisions are only created for volumes which have the `save_on_stop`
property set.  Revision creation is storage driver implementation-dependent,
but the general practice is that a revision is only created when a volume is
clean.  Paradoxically and despite the `save_on_stop` name, revisions in these
volumes are created prior to its owning qube starting, rather than when its
owning qube stops.

You may not revert a volume while it is in use.  This includes its owning qube
running.  With some storage drivers, this also extends to cases when the volume
is currently being exported to use in a `qvm-clone` operation.

aliases: rv, r

import
^^^^^^
| :command:`qvm-volume import` [-h] [--size=SIZE|--no-resize] [--verbose] [--quiet] *VMNAME:VOLUME* *PATH*

Import file *PATH* into volume *VMNAME:VOLUME*. Use `-` as *PATH* to import from
stdin.

The tool will try to resize volume to match input size before the import. In
case of importing from stdin, you may need to provide size explicitly with
`--size` option. You can keep previous volume size by using `--no-resize`
option.

A specific use case is importing empty data to clear private volume:

| :command:`qvm-volume` import --no-resize some-vm:private /dev/null

Old data will be stored as a revision, subject to `revisions_to_keep` limit.

.. option:: --size

   Provide the size explicitly, instead of using *FILE* size.

.. option:: --no-resize

   Do not resize volume before the import.
